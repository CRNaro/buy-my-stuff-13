## Description

This project is a back end for an e-commerce website built using Express.js. It utilizes the Sequelize ORM to interact with a MySQL database. E-commerce, a significant sector within the electronics industry, enables businesses and consumers to engage in online buying and selling conveniently. This application aims to provide the latest technologies to empower internet retail companies to compete effectively in the e-commerce market.

## Usage

To use this application, you need to set up your environment variables for the database connection. Refer to the Perquisites and Installation sections below for detailed instructions. Once set up, you can start the server and interact with the API endpoints using tools like Insomnia Core.

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MySQL database installed and running
- Insomnia Core or similar tool for API testing

### Installation
1. Clone the starter code repository from here.
2. Set up your environment variables by creating a .env file in the root directory. Add the following variables:
makefile
Copy code
DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
DB_USER='root'
DB_PASSWORD=''
3. Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
4. Enter schema and seed commands to create a development database and seed it with test data.

### Running the Application
1. After completing the installation steps, run npm start to start the server.
2. Once the server is running, the Sequelize models will be synced to the MySQL database.
